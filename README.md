# Textual_Analysis
Textual analysis examines written, spoken, or visual communication to uncover meaning, patterns, and relationships. It involves analyzing content, language, structure, and context to interpret texts and understand their cultural, social, or ideological implications.
**README: Textual Analysis Project**

This project involved analyzing over 150 URLs to extract data and conduct textual analysis. Using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and NLTK, we parsed content, performed sentiment analysis, and identified key themes. Results are summarized in structured reports for insights into trends and patterns across diverse sources.

**Key Steps:**
1. **Data Collection:** URLs were scraped using Python's requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
   
2. **Text Extraction:** Content was extracted and cleaned to prepare for analysis.
   
3. **Textual Analysis:** Utilizing NLTK and custom scripts, we conducted sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and keyword extraction.
   
4. **Reporting:** Findings were compiled into structured reports highlighting trends and insights.

**Tools Used:**
- Python (requests, BeautifulSoup, NLTK)
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Jupyter Notebooks for analysis and visualization

**Outcome:**
Insights gained from this analysis provide valuable understanding of textual trends and sentiments across a diverse dataset of URLs.

**Future Steps:**
Refine analysis techniques for more nuanced insights. Explore machine learning models for deeper understanding of textual content.
